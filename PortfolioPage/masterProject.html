    <h2>Design Process: The Double Diamond</h2>
    <p>The design process followed the Double Diamond framework, which consists of four key phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. This approach ensures a thorough understanding of the problem and a structured path toward an optimal solution.</p>
    <img src="images/doubleDiamond.png" alt="Double Diamond Process Illustration">
    <p>The "Discover" phase involved extensive user research and problem exploration. During "Define," insights were synthesized to pinpoint the core problem. In "Develop," ideas were brainstormed and prototyped. Finally, in "Deliver," the solution was refined and implemented.</p>
